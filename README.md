# Voice-Enabled-RAG-Chatbot-
This project is a powerful, voice-enabled chatbot that answers questions by combining information from a user-uploaded PDF and live web search results. It leverages a multi-modal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline to understand and reason over both text and images within the PDF, providing accurate, cited, and visually-supported answers.
